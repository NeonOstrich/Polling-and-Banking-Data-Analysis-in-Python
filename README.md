# Unit 3 Homework: Python

This is an assignment that I completed for the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp, focused on analysis in Python.

## Background

In this project, I am performing two analyses called PyPoll and PyBank.
PyPoll consists analyzing polling data for a small town. It focuses on the dataset, election_data.csv, 
which holds data in in three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

PyBank consists of analyzing financial data for a company. It focuses on the dataset, budget_data.csv,
which holds data in two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

## Organization

Within PyBank and PyPoll you will find the Python code for my analysis as well as an "analysis" and a "Resources" file.

The "Resources" file contains the csv file that is analyzed, and the "analysis" file contains a text output of the analysis.

## PyBank 

My Python script analyzes budget_data.csv to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll 

My Python script analyzes election_data.csv to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
