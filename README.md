# Unit 3 Homework: Python

This is an assignment that I completed for the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp, focused on analysis in Python.

## Background

In this project, I am performing two analyses called PyPoll and PyBank.
PyPoll consists analyzing polling data for a small town. It focuses on the dataset, election_data.csv, 
which holds data in in three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

PyBank consists of analyzing financial data for a company. It focuses on the dataset, budget_data.csv,
which holds data in two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

## Organization

Within PyBank and PyPoll you will find the Python code for my analysis as well as an "analysis" and a "Resources" file.
The "Resources" file contains the csv file that is analyzed, and the "analysis" file contains a text output of the analysis.

PyBank offers an analysis of the budget data provided, which can be used to judge the companies performance over the period of
time measured, and provide valuable insights to potential investors as well as organizational leadership.

PyPoll provides an analysis of the election results for a town, which can be used to judge the comparative success of each candidate.
This analysis can be a roadmap for voters and campaign contributors who are looking to maximize their impact as well as the candidates themselves.

## PyBank 

My Python script analyzes budget_data.csv to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll 

My Python script analyzes election_data.csv to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
